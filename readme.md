## Practice Using Git and Github

In this repository, I'm using Git to practice version control while working on a text file called 'The Constitution (America).' This project allows me to simulate a real-world scenario where multiple contributors make changes, in this case, amendments and other modifications, to an important document. By using Git, I can track and manage these changes, collaborate with others, and gain hands-on experience in version control. This practice not only helps me improve my Git skills but also deepens my understanding of how collaborative projects are managed, making me better prepared for real-world software development and collaboration scenarios. Additionally, as I work on this project, I'm also reinforcing my knowledge of the Bill of Rights and other amendments to the Constitution, making it a valuable learning experience on multiple fronts.
